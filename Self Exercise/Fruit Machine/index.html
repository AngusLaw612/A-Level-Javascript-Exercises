      <p>The player starts with £1 credit, with each go costing 20p. If the Fruit Machine rolls two of the same symbol,
        <br> the player wins 50p. The player wins £1 for three of the same symbol and £5 for three Bells.
        <br> The player loses £1 if two Skulls are rolled and loses all their money if three Skulls are rolled.
        <br> After each roll, the player can choose to quit with their winnings or keep playing until there is no money left.</p>
